# Supported Go versions

We follow Go's release policy, meaning we target its latest minor version and the minor version before
(at the time of writing the latest version is 1.19, so we target 1.18 as minimum version).

While we don't randomly upgrade the minimum Go version required to use this package, we upgrade whenever we
want or need a feature from the newer version.
