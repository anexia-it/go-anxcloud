// Object is the interface all objects to be retrieved by the generic API client are required to implement.
//
// On top of implementing this interface, an Object is always implemented as a struct, the pointer to it is what is passed to the generic API client.
// These Object structs need to have a member with `anxcloud:"identifier"` tag on it. Only strings and "github.com/satori/go.uuid".UUID identifiers
// are supported for now (look in pkg/api/object.go_getObjectIdentifier for code specifying the allowed types).
type Object interface {
	// Returns the URL to retrieve resources of the given type from or an error.
	// The request URL is formed of `client.BaseURL() + first return value of this function`, requests for a single object get
	// the object identifier appended to the path, a / added as needed. APIs using other URL schemes need to implement RequestFilterHook.

// IdentifiedObject is the same as Object and is intended as a doc-helper. Objects are IdentifiedObjects when their
// identifying attribute (commonly something like "Identifier") is set.
type IdentifiedObject Object

// FilterObject is the same as Object and is intended as a doc-helper, telling the user only it's type and it implementing an interface is important for the generic API client.
// Some of the attributes on this Object can be used for filtering or searching, depending on the specific API.
type FilterObject Object

// RequestFilterHook is an interface Objects can optionally implement to modify requests before they are sent to the engine.

// RequestBodyHook is an interface Objects can optionally implement to customize request bodies based on the object given by the user of this library.
type RequestBodyHook interface {
	// FilterAPIRequestBody returns the object to be sent as request body. Not implementing this interface is equivalent to returning the received object from this function.

// ResponseFilterHook is an interface Objects can optionally implement to modify response given by the engine before they are decoded.
type ResponseFilterHook interface {
	// FilterAPIResponse is called after a response from the engine regarding this object is received. Instead of the original response, the one returned by this function is decoded.
	FilterAPIResponse(op Operation, options Options, res *http.Response) (*http.Response, error)

// PaginationSupportHook is an interface Objects can optionally implement to enable or disable pagination support for List operations.
type PaginationSupportHook interface {
	// Returns if the API supports pagination for List operations. Mind optionally supported filters in EndpointURL, which may go to different API endpoints which independently might
	// or might not support pagination.
	HasPagination(ctx context.Context, options Options) (bool, error)
